# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A **Collaborative Filtering-based Movie Recommendation System** is designed to predict user ratings for movies and recommend content tailored to individual preferences. This approach helps users discover movies they might enjoy, even if they haven't seen them yet, just like systems used by Netflix and Amazon.

## 🧠 About the Project

Recommender systems are essential for digital platforms that offer millions of choices. Our goal is to narrow down those options and deliver **personalized recommendations** using **Collaborative Filtering**, which works by identifying patterns in user behavior.

This project predicts how a user would rate a movie they haven’t watched yet by learning from historical ratings data. The objective is to minimize the prediction error using evaluation metrics like **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
